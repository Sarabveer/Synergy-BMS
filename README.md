[Synergy] Black Mesa:S Edt Files
===========
Hello, these are the *(WORK IN PROGRESS)* .edt and .inc files for Black Mesa Source.

These edts are unofficial, and is a 3rd Party Project!

**FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE**

##How to: Make a BMS Synergy Server
- Download the BMS archive at the [Black Mesa Website(http://www.blackmesasource.com/#download)
- Extract it to a BMS folder, put the BMS folder in the *common* directory
- Your Synergy Server Directory should look like this
```
common/BMS
common/Half-Life 2
common/Synergy
```
- Download the **Unofficial BMS EDTS** as a *.zip* and place the *.edt* and *.inc* files into your ***Synergy*** *maps* folder.
- Add ***bms*** to the *mount.cache* file
- Set the startup map to *bm_c0a0a*
- Run The Server
- ?????
- Profit.

**Bugs:**
- No Sound (Only Ambient Sound)
- HL2 Player Models
- No AI (The NPC's might randomly die :P)
- No mapchange after tram ride has finised on [u]bm_c0a3a[/u]

##WARNING
The **.edt** files are unofficial and are buggy. I have put them on GitHub so anyone can contribute to make them better! But, I am not respnsible if you mess up your copy of Synergy and/or your Synergy server.
