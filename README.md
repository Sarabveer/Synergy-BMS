[Synergy] Black Mesa:S Edt Files
===========
Hello, these are the *(WORK IN PROGRESS)* .edt and .inc files for Black Mesa Source.

**FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE**

To use BMS, you have to have it installed in the "common" Directory for Synergy Server to mount it. Your mount.cache has to have "bms". Also you have to copy the .edt and .inc files into your **Synergy** maps folder.  

##Warning 
These files are in the works and are in an APLHA stage, I am mot respnsible if you mess up your copy of Synergy and/or your Synergy server.
