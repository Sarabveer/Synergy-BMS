##How to: Make a BMS Synergy Server
- Download the BMS archive at the [url=http://www.blackmesasource.com/#download]Black Mesa Website[/url]
- Extract it to a BMS folder, put the BMS folder in the [u]common[/u] directory
- Your Synergy Server Directory should look like this
```
common/BMS
common/Half-Life 2
common/Synergy
```
- Download the [b]Unofficial BMS EDTS[/b] from my [url=https://github.com/Sarabveer/Synergy-BMS]GitHub[/url] page
- Download it as a [u].zip[/u] and place the [b].edt[/b] and [b].inc[/b] files into your [b][u]Synergy[/u][/b] maps folder.
- Add [b]bms[/b] to the [u]mount.cache[/u] file
- Set the startup map to [u]bm_c0a0a[/u]
- Run The Server
- ?????
- Profit.

**Bugs:**
- No Sound (Only Ambient Sound)
- HL2 Player Models
- No AI (The NPC's might randomly die :P)
- No mapchange after tram ride has finised on [u]bm_c0a3a[/u]

##WARNING
***The **.edt** and **.inc** files are unofficial and are buggy. I have put them on GitHub so anyone can contribute to make them better! But, I am not respnsible if you mess up your copy of Synergy and/or your Synergy server.***
