[Synergy] Black Mesa Edt Files
===========
Hello, these are the `.edt` and `.inc` files for Black Mesa Source.

These edts are unofficial, and is a 3rd Party Project!

## How to: Make a BMS Synergy Server
- Download and Install Black Mesa from Steam: [Black Mesa - Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa)
- Your Synergy Server Directory should look like this:
```
common/Black Mesa
common/Half-Life 2
common/Synergy
```
- In the `common/Synergy/synergy/custom` folder, make a new folder called `BMS`. In that folder, make a folder named `maps`.
- Copy the *.edt* and *.inc* files into the maps folder.
- Run The Server with the startup map set to `d1_trainstation_01`
- When the Server is loaded, run the command `changelevel "blackmesa" "bm_c0a0a"`

**Bugs:**
- No Sound (Only Ambient Sound)
- HL2 Player Models
- No AI (The NPC's might randomly die :P)
- No mapchange after tram ride has finised on ***bm_c0a3a***

### WARNING
The **.edt** files are unofficial and are buggy. I have put them on GitHub so anyone can contribute to make them better! But, I am not respnsible if you mess up your copy of Synergy and/or your Synergy server.
